## Research Summary

The chemical reaction networks hypothesized to be operating at the dawn of life have been traditionally regarded as a highly diverse and complex chemical ecosystem. In order for a biosphere to emerge on a planet, these reaction networks have to transition from a high to a moderate complexity state in which a subset of the possible chemical flows within the system dominate. We would like to understand the conditions governning this transition, what type of catalytic network architecture is required, what is the minimal artificial chemistry that models this process and what types of flows are favored in such condtions. Finally, one of the possible proposed mechanisms for such transition to occur implies the emergence of some form of cellularity and the consequent coupling to a chemical reaction network. We would like to explore the implications of that coupling for the conditions that may lead to these transitions.
